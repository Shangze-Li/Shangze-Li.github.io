<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master’s student at Nanjing University of Science and Technology.
My research interests focus on the safety and interpretability of large foundation models, including large language models and text-to-image diffusion models.
I work on neuron- and path-level analysis to understand and mitigate harmful generation, with recent research on path-level intervention and cultural bias in generative models.
My work has appeared as preprints on arXiv.
